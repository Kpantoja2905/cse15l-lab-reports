# ___Lab 1 Report___

> ## Overview
During this week 1 Lectures we learned commands such as `cd`, `ls`, and `cat`. The commands are used in order to be able to access and see specific files or directories. During the lab, we put the following commands into practice by using the commands to change or access specific directories from the repository that we were able to clone for GitHub using the command `git clone` which allowed us to clone into our VS code terminal in order to execute the commands we learned in lecture.
